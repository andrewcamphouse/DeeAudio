Voice Readme

Andrew Camphouse, Alison Cross, and Anthony Conte created this peer-to-peer voice chat application as an entry in Lewis University's first ever Hackathon. HackFlyers 2017 involved creating a unique or creative project within 24 hours. Known as "DeeAudio", the project was awarded first place upon the conclusion of the event. 

The project is written in Python and utilizes sockets. Users connect to one another by sharing IP addresses. If User A is listening when User B connects, User A will hear User B's voice. This process can be completed by both users for simultaneous voice chat.
